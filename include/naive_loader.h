 * 
 * 
 * The universe loader reads a text file, and returns the universe, as implemented in naive_universe.h, 
 * that is represented by the text file.
 * 
 * 
 * The text file must be formatted like this :
 * - The first line contains the width and height of the map, separated by a space
 * - The second line is the number of steps
 * - The others lines represents the universe, with the convention :
 *      - 'o' represents an alive cell
 *      - '.' represents an empty cell
 *
